== Working with virtual environment

    python3 -m venv ~/tools/scikit
    source ~/tools/scikit/bin/activate


== Installing older python3 versions via homebrew

In case homebrew delivers to new version instal older version and switch to this. E.g. if tensorflow is not yet compatible with python 3.7 (as in end 2018)
